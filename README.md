## Why Use issue-solver-bots

In today's fast-paced development environment, teams often spend valuable time on "Low-Value" (or routine) tasks that
could be automated.
**Issue-solver-bots** empowers your team by:

- **Innovate and Modernize**: Enhance development workflows without being tied to a single platform.
- **Seamless Integration**: Improve existing infrastructure and build processes without overhauling everything or
  compromising security.
- **Avoid Migration Hassles**: Integrate new capabilities without the need for massive migration projects.

## Features

- üõ†Ô∏è **CI/CD Templates**: Ready-to-use templates for **GitLab CI** ü¶ä and **GitHub Actions** üêà‚Äç‚¨õ to automate issue
  resolution using advanced agents like **SWE-agent** and **SWE-crafter**.
- üîç **Flexible Issue Resolution**: Resolve issues via their ID, URL, or description (provided as a parameter or through
  MR/PR description).
- üîó **Multi-Platform Integration**: Integration with various issue tracking platforms (**GitLab**, **GitHub**). üìù **Jira
  and Notion integrations coming soon!** üöß
- üìö **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides for quick and efficient setup.

- **GitLab** or **GitHub** account.
- Access to a **GitLab Runner** or **GitHub Runner** with Docker capabilities.
- **Personal Access Tokens** and **API Keys** as required by the agents.
- **Docker** installed on your runner (if self-hosted).

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umans-tech/issue-solver-bots.git
   cd issue-solver-bots
   ```

2. **Review the Documentation:**

    - For **GitLab CI** setup: Refer to [`docs/gitlab-ci-setup.md`](docs/gitlab-ci-setup.md)
    - For **GitHub Actions** setup: Refer to [`docs/github-actions-setup.md`](docs/github-actions-setup.md)

## Usage

### GitLab CI Integration

Integrate with GitLab CI in just a few steps:

1. **Include the Template:**

   Add the following to your project's `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   include:
     - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umans-tech/issue-solver-bots/main/gitlab-ci/solve-issues.yml'
   ```

2. **Set Required Environment Variables:**

   In your project's **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**, add the necessary variables as per
   the [GitLab CI Documentation](docs/gitlab-ci-setup.md).

3. **Trigger the Pipeline:**

    - Create a new merge request with a detailed description, or
    - Manually trigger the pipeline by specifying issue-related variables.

> üí° **Tip:** Option 1 is tested and confirmed to work with GitLab.com's managed runners, making it an excellent choice
> for users who rely on GitLab's shared CI infrastructure.

### GitHub Actions Integration

Integrate with GitHub Actions easily:

1. **Copy the Workflow File:**

   Copy the provided workflow file into your project's `.github/workflows` directory.

2. **Set Required Secrets:**

   In your repository's **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**, add the necessary secrets as per
   the [GitHub Actions Documentation](docs/github-actions-setup.md).

3. **Trigger the Workflow:**

    - Open a new pull request with a detailed description, or
