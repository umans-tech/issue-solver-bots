# Tasks & Processes Feature

## Overview

This feature provides a comprehensive interface for viewing and managing tasks and processes in the current user workspace. The implementation includes both a tasks list view and detailed individual task pages with modern, clean design principles.

## Features Added

### 1. Main Tasks List Page (`/tasks`)

- **Grid Layout**: Displays tasks in a responsive card grid (1-3 columns based on screen size)
- **Search & Filters**: 
  - Search by task ID, title, or description
  - Filter by status (All, Completed, In Progress, Failed, Connected, Indexed)
  - Filter by process type (dynamically populated from available tasks)
- **Modern Card Design**: Each task card shows:
  - Task title with clear typography
  - Process type with appropriate icons
  - Status badges with color coding and icons
  - Relative timestamps (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")
  - Process ID (truncated for better UX)
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Color-coded borders based on status
  - Animated status icons for in-progress tasks
  - Smooth hover transitions

### 2. Enhanced Task Detail Page (`/tasks/[processId]`)

- **Comprehensive Header**: 
  - Large task title with process type icons
  - Process ID in monospace font
  - Multiple status and type badges
  - Action buttons for completed/failed tasks
- **Process Information Card**:
  - Basic information (ID, type, status)
  - Timing details (created, updated, event count)
  - Events summary with visual timeline
  - Clean two-column layout on larger screens
- **Enhanced Status Display**:
  - Real-time status indicators
  - Animated progress indicators for active tasks
  - Clear error state handling with detailed error dialogs

### 3. API Integration

### 4. Navigation Integration
