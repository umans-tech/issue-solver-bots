Use the following types:
- `feat`: A new feature

- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries
