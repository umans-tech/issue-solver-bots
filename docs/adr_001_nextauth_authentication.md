# ADR 001: Use NextAuth.js for Authentication

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our application requires a secure authentication system that supports both traditional email/password login and social provider authentication. Users expect modern authentication options including social login (such as Google, GitHub, etc.) and email verification for enhanced security. We need a solution that integrates well with our Next.js-based frontend and provides a good developer experience.

Key requirements for our authentication system:
- Support for multiple authentication providers (social logins, email/password)
- Email verification flow
- JWT-based session management
- Seamless integration with our Next.js application
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Secure credential handling

## Decision

We will use NextAuth.js as our authentication solution with support for:
1. Social providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
2. Email authentication with verification
3. JWT session handling

NextAuth.js is a complete authentication solution designed specifically for Next.js applications. It provides built-in support for various authentication providers, session management, and TypeScript integration.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Simplified Authentication Flow**: NextAuth.js provides pre-built components and hooks that simplify authentication implementation.
- **Multiple Provider Support**: Easy integration with popular OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) and custom credential providers.
- **Security**: NextAuth.js follows security best practices for authentication, reducing the risk of common security vulnerabilities.
- **TypeScript Support**: Built-in TypeScript definitions ensure type safety.
- **Next.js Integration**: Designed specifically for Next.js, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility.
- **Maintenance**: Actively maintained library with regular updates and security patches.
- **Email Verification**: Built-in support for email verification flows.

### Negative

- **Dependency**: Introduces a dependency on a third-party library.
- **Learning Curve**: Team members will need to learn NextAuth.js specific patterns and APIs.
- **Configuration Complexity**: Setting up multiple providers requires careful configuration.
- **Database Requirements**: For persistent sessions and user accounts, we need proper database integration.

## Implementation Details

We will implement NextAuth.js in the following phases:

1. Configure basic NextAuth.js setup with credential provider (email/password)
2. Add social login providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
3. Implement email verification flow
4. Integrate with our user database for persistent sessions and user information

The implementation will involve:
- Setting up NextAuth.js API routes
- Configuring authentication providers
- Creating login/registration UI components
- Implementing protected routes using NextAuth.js session management
- Adding TypeScript types for auth-related entities
