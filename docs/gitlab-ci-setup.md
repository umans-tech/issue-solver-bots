# GitLab CI Setup for issue-solver-bots

## Introduction

The `solve-issues` template provided by issue-solver-bots automates the resolution of issues using SWE-agent. This
template can be easily integrated into your existing GitLab CI/CD pipelines to enhance and innovate your development
workflow without compromising security or requiring large-scale migrations.

## Features

- üõ†Ô∏è Automates issue resolution via SWE-agent.
- üîç Supports resolving issues by ID or description.
- üöÄ Can be triggered manually or through merge request events.
- üîó Integrates seamlessly with GitLab projects.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Uses the `MODEL_NAME` environment variable to specify the model, defaulting to `gpt4o`.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitLab Runner**: Ensure you have a GitLab Runner configured to run Docker.
2. **Access Tokens**: Set up the following environment variables in your GitLab CI/CD settings:
    - `CODING_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Personal access token with access to your GitLab project.
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for accessing OpenAI services.
    - `MODEL_NAME` (optional): Name of the model to use (default is `gpt4o`).

## Setup

### Include the Template in Your `.gitlab-ci.yml`

Add the following line to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` to include the `solve-issues` template:

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umans-tech/issue-solver-bots/main/gitlab-ci/solve-issues.yml'
```

### Configure Your Pipeline

Configure your pipeline to use the `solve-issues` job. An example configuration is shown below:

```yaml
stages:
  - code
  - test

include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umans-tech/issue-solver-bots/main/gitlab-ci/solve-issues.yml'

unit-test-job:
  image: python:3.10-alpine
  stage: test
  before_script:
    - pip install -e ".[dev]"
  script:
    - pytest
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"'
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_TAG'
    - when: manual
```

## Usage

### Merge Request Event

When a merge request is created, the `solve-issues` job will check if the merge request description is empty and if no
files have been changed. If these conditions are met, the job will proceed to resolve the issue.

### Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger the `solve-issues` job by specifying issue-related variables:

- `GITLAB_ISSUE_ID`: The ID of the GitLab issue to be resolved.
- `ISSUE_URL`: The URL of the issue.
- `ISSUE_DESCRIPTION`: A description of the issue to be resolved.

#### Example

To trigger the job manually, go to your project's CI/CD pipelines, click on "Run pipeline", and set the necessary
variables:

- **GITLAB_ISSUE_ID**: `123`
- **ISSUE_URL**: `https://gitlab.com/your-project/issues/123`
- **ISSUE_DESCRIPTION**: `Description of the issue to resolve`

### Detailed Steps in `solve-issues` Job

1. **Checking Conditions**: The job checks the conditions for automated coding based on merge request or manual trigger
   parameters.
2. **Creating Data Path**: It creates a markdown file containing the issue description.
3. **Pulling Docker Images**: The required Docker images are pulled.
4. **Generating Patch**: The job runs the SWE-agent to generate a patch based on the issue description, using the
   selected model (specified by the `MODEL_NAME` environment variable, defaulting to `gpt4o` if not set).
5. **Committing Changes**: The changes are committed and pushed back to the repository.

## Conclusion

By integrating the `solve-issues` template into your GitLab CI/CD pipeline, you can automate the resolution of issues
and enhance your development workflow without compromising security or undergoing massive migrations. If you have any
